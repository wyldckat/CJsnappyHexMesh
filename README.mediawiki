= Description =
Brought to my attention here: [http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/openfoam/105558-need-directtopochange-h.html]

Source of modifications at [http://www.tfd.chalmers.se/~hani/kurser/OS_CFD_2011/]:
* Christoffer Järpner: Projection of a mesh on an stl surface. [http://www.tfd.chalmers.se/~hani/kurser/OS_CFD_2011/ChristofferJarpner/OpenFOAMPPTChristofferJarpner.pdf Slides], [http://www.tfd.chalmers.se/~hani/kurser/OS_CFD_2011/ChristofferJarpner/ReportInOpenFOAMbyChristofferJarpner.pdf Report], [http://www.tfd.chalmers.se/~hani/kurser/OS_CFD_2011/ChristofferJarpner/UpdatedmysnappyHexMesh.zip Code], [http://www.tfd.chalmers.se/~hani/kurser/OS_CFD_2011/ChristofferJarpner/UpdatedSnappyTestCase.zip Case]

Original sources from OpenFOAM 2.1.x and 1.6-ext:
* 2.1.x commit 334ec14f742f95b1198bc0de318d625fc724b5e7
* 1.6-ext commit c04489736fa1e44c123c6d801f54044f2679bfca

= Usage instructions =

# Download, either using <code>git</code> or use the ''Downloads'' pseudo-button on the top right at [https://github.com/wyldckat/CJsnappyHexMesh].
# Depending on whether you're using 1.6-ext or 2.1.x, go into the respective <code>CJsnappyHexMesh*</code> folder.
# Run: <pre>wmake</pre>
# Go to the respective case folder <code>tutorials/SnappyTestCase-*</code> and there you can run one of the following 2 commands: <pre>./Allrun
./Allrun2</pre>
# Read the comments in <code>Allrun2</code> to learn the differences between the two scripts.
# Reset the case folder by running: <pre>./Allclean</pre>

= Additional adaptations =
Given that Christoffer Järpner's modifications were meant for 1.6-ext, there were several adaptations required for things to work with 2.1.x. Those were:
<ol><li>Had to include:
<pre>#include "polyTopoChange.H"
#include "polyTopoChanger.H"</pre>
Instead of:
<pre>#include "directTopoChange.H"</pre></li>
<li>This lead to renaming the references of <code>directTopoChange</code> to <code>polyTopoChange</code>.</li>
<li>Added references to <code>dynamicFvMesh</code> in <code>Make/options</code>.</li>
<li>This: <pre>boolList boundaryPoint(mesh.allPoints().size(), false);</pre> Changed to this: <pre>boolList boundaryPoint(mesh.points().size(), false);</pre></li>
<li>Had to ''stich by hand'' some of the modifications to <code>mysnappyHexMesh.C</code>.</li>
</ol>

Whenever there was a problem during the build, I looked for the variable/class/name in 1.6-ext's folder <code>applications/utilities</code> using <code>grep</code>. Example:
<pre>grep -r "directTopoChange.H" *</pre>
Then looked at <code>grep</code>'s output, picked out a file where the occurence was found and opened the respective file in 2.1.x. Compared the differences and ''voilà''!
